# Privacy Policy for AI Chat Exporter

**Last Updated: February 2025**

## Overview

AI Chat Exporter is a browser extension that allows users to export their AI conversations from ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Grok (X) to JSON format. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles data.

## Data Collection

**AI Chat Exporter does not collect, store, transmit, or share any user data.**

Specifically:
- We do not collect personal information
- We do not collect conversation data
- We do not use cookies or tracking technologies
- We do not sell or share data with third parties

## Data Processing

All processing performed by AI Chat Exporter occurs **entirely within your browser**:

1. **Content Extraction**: The extension reads conversation content from the current webpage only when you initiate an export
2. **JSON Generation**: Conversations are converted to JSON format locally on your device
3. **Export**: Data is either copied to your clipboard or downloaded as a file - both actions happen entirely on your device

**No data ever leaves your browser.**

AI Chat Exporter requests the following browser permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `activeTab` | Access the current tab to extract conversation content when you click export |
| `scripting` | Inject export buttons into supported AI chat platforms |
| `storage` | Save your preferences (which metadata fields to include in exports) locally |

## Third-Party Services

AI Chat Exporter does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external servers.
